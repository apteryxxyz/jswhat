# ü§î What is what?

`jsWhat` is a JavaScript version of the existing [pyWhat](https://github.com/bee-san/pyWhat). Works in NodeJS, the browser and the command line.

Have you ever come across a mysterious üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è piece of text and wondered what it might be? Perhaps something like `rBxwE6ivExFJjRPh5cZtpq1ghTDm6cV5YP` or `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`?

Well with `what` all you have to do is ask `what rBxwE6ivExFJjRPh5cZtpq1ghTDm6cV5YP` and it will tell you!
You can even feed `what` more than one piece of text and it will try to identify them all (`what rBxwE6ivExFJjRPh5cZtpq1ghTDm6cV5YP 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

`what`s' job is to help you by identifing what something is. Whether it be a simple string of text, a file, or even a URL! `what` can read a file and identify text within it, fetch data from a URL and identify text within that data, or simply identify a string of text.

# üì© Installation

Command Line/NodeJS using NPM:

```npm install jswhat --global```

Browser using unpkg CDN:

```<script src="https://unpkg.com/jswhat/dist/what.min.js"></script>```


# üçï API

## üíª Command Line

Once installed globally, you will gain access to the `what` command. You can use `what --help` to see a basic help menu containing usage, option inforamtion and examples. You can also use the command `jswhat`, which is just an alias to `what`.

### Usage
`what <text> [options]`

### Options

```
 -h, --help                Show help message.
 -v, --version             Show the installed version of jsWhat.
 -s, --search              Search globally within a string.
 -n, --nontext             The text input is a file path or URL.
 -t, --tags                Show all the available tags.
 -f, --filter              Filter the results by names or tags, separate by commons.
 -e, --exclude             Exclude results based on names and tags, separate by commons.
```

### Text

When wanting to identify some basic text, you can simply type `what <text>` and `what` will try to identify what it is. You can also identify multiple stirngs by simply feeding `what` more strings (with spaces in between) like `what <text> <text> <text>`. In fact, any argument that does not start with a dash (-) will be treated as a string to identify.

### File

You have the ability to use `what` to scan a file and identify the content within. All you need to do is pass a file path as the text argument and enable the `nontext` option. For example `what path/to/file --nontext`. The `nontext` is required to ensure you are meaning to scan a file, as you could be looking to identify the path to the file itself instead.

### URL

You can also use `what` to scan the text from the other end of a URL. It could be the HTML of a site like `https://www.google.com/` or the contents of a file hosted online, like `https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt`, example `what https://url.to/text --nontext`. This also requires the `nontext` option for the same reason as a file.

## üü¢ NodeJS

The node module is also very simply, containing onty a single method.

`<what>.is(<text>, [search], [options])`
- `<text> {string}` = Content to be identified.
- `[search] {boolean}` = Wether or not to search the content globally.
- `[options.nontext] {boolean}` = Wether or not the text should be treated as a file path or URL.
- `[options.filter] {string|string[]}` = A string or array of names or tags to filter results by.
- `[options.exclude] {string|string[]}` = A string or array of names or tags to exclude from the results.

```js
const what = require('jswhat');

const result = what.is('e@mail.com');
// Email (e@mail.com)

const search = what.is('e@mail.com', true);
// Email (e@mail.com), URL (mail.com)

const nontext = await what.is('https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt', true, { nontext : true })
// this returns a promise
// Phone Number (2021062100), SSN (202106210), Timestamp (2021062100)

const filter = what.is(['microsoft@hotmail.com', 'google@gmail.com'], true, { filter: 'Uniform Resource Locator (URL)' });
// URL (hotmail.com), URL (gmail.com)

// if an error is produce
```

### Output

The above method will return an array of objects in the following format:

```js
[
  {
    "matched": String, // the content that was identified
    "name": String, // what it was identified as
    "description": String, // a description of what was identified
    "url": String, // a URL, sometimes linking to somewhere with more information
    "regex": RegExp, // the regex that was used to identify the text
    "tags": String[] // array of tags for the identified
  },
  ...
  text: String, // the strings passed into the method
  error: Error, // if the method produces an error, if will appear in this property

]
```

## üì∫ Browser

`jsWhat` works the same way in the browser as in NodeJS, although without the ability to read a file or fetch a URL, AKA no `nontext` option.


`what.is(<text>, [search], [options])`
- `<text> {string}` = Content to be identified.
- `[search] {boolean}` = Wether or not to search the content globally.
- `[options.filter] {string|string[]}` = A string or array of names or tags to filter results by.
- `[options.exclude] {string|string[]}` = A string or array of names or tags to exclude from the results.

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jswhat/dist/what.min.js"></script>

<script>
  console.log(what.is('e@mail.com'));
  // Email (e@mail.com)

  console.log(what.is('e@mail.com', true));
  // Email (e@mail.com), URL (mail.com)

  console.log(what.is(['microsoft@hotmail.com', 'google@gmail.com'], true, { exclude: 'Email Address' }));
  // URL (hotmail.com), URL (gmail.com)
<script/>
```

The output for the above is the same as [NodeJS](#output).
